I don't want it to be perfect or in some "polished" state, I want it to be <b>DONE NO MATTER WHAT</b>. <br> I'm great at not finish things. Always. 2021 is the year to make it change, and this is why I consider an attempt as finished when I don't have more time to spend on. I don't care if it's ugly, bad coded, or else. After all, it's an "attempt", not a "perfect thing to polish". <br> That way, I can make another attempt on a same challenge, and see my progress. <br><br> I want to do 1 attempt a day, for 100 day. I'll use Bootstrap, to begin. Maybe i'll try more "hand-coded" things as things progress. </p> <h3>Challenge list :</h3> <ul> <li><a href="profile-card.html">001 - Profile Card (1st version - 01/01/2021)</a></li> <li><a href="faq-accordion-card.html">002 - FAQ Card (1st version - 02/01/2021)</a></li> </ul> <br> <br> <br> <p>Some of the learning resources I like will be listed there.</p> <h3>Learning resources :</h3> <ul> <li>Traversy Media : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb"></a> </li> <li>FreeCodeCamp : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ"></a> </li> <li>The Net Ninja : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg"></a> </li> <li>The Nerdy Dev : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWWRLPeMNMeDhpfE7R6qCyw"></a> </li> <li>Grafikart : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/grafikarttv"></a> </li> </ul> </body></html>
